ASP.NET MVC app to track and analyze diet info.

The app uses the USDA FNDDS (Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies) for all food listings and nutrition information. It was originally in JSON format, which was converted into a relational SQLite database.

FNDDS: https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/docs/fndds/
